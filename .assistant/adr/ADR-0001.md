Decision: Ship MatoKit as an Express-based Opal tool service backed by the shared Matomo SDK.
Alternatives:
- Expose Matomo APIs directly to assistants without an intermediary service.
- Build the service on Fastify or serverless functions to optimize performance or cold-start costs.
Consequences:
- Keeps SDK and API co-located with minimal routing boilerplate and aligns with existing Express expertise in the team.
- Centralizes auth, caching, error translation, and discovery metadata, simplifying downstream LLM integrations.
- Requires long-running Node processes with appropriate monitoring and scaling strategies.
