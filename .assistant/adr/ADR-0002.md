Decision: Maintain an in-memory reporting cache with observable hit/miss metrics for initial deployments.
Alternatives:
- Persist cache entries in Redis or Memcached to share state across instances.
- Skip caching entirely and rely on Matomo response times for every request.
Consequences:
- Simple to operate for single-instance deployments and keeps latency low without extra infrastructure.
- Cache state disappears on restart; scaling horizontally will require coordination or a new storage layer.
- Telemetry hooks give us the data needed to justify future investments in durable caching.
