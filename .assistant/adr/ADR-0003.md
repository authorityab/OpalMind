Decision: Handle Matomo Tracking API retries with an in-memory queue managed by the API service.
Alternatives:
- Delegate retries to external job infrastructure (BullMQ, SQS, etc.).
- Skip retries and surface Tracking API failures directly to callers.
Consequences:
- Provides immediate resilience against transient Matomo outages with minimal moving parts.
- Queue contents are lost on restart, so persistence work must follow before higher availability deployments.
- Coupling queue management to the API process keeps implementation simple but constrains horizontal scaling.
