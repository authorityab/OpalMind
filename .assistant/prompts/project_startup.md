# Project Startup Instructions

We are starting a new project.
Your role: initialize the `.assistant/` workspace and prepare the team to build.

## Steps
1. Read `.assistant/canvas/` (vision, goals, stakeholders, questions).
2. Draft an initial backlog (`backlog.md`) with IDs, metadata, and acceptance criteria.
3. Create an initial `plan.md` (Now, Next, Later).
4. Set `status.md` with current Focus, Risks, initial Artifacts, **and an Open Questions block**.
5. From `canvas/questions.md`, highlight key unknowns and propose research actions (context7 MCP).
6. If decisions are implied (stack, hosting, data), propose ADR stubs in `.assistant/adr/` and link in `status.md -> Artifacts`.
7. **Copy unresolved items from `.assistant/canvas/questions.md` into the `status.md -> Open Questions` section.**

## Output
- Updated `.assistant/backlog.md`, `.assistant/plan.md`, `.assistant/status.md`.
- ADR drafts for any key decisions.
- A short first-session plan to begin implementation.
