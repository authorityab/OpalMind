# End Session (with MCPs)
1) Summarize today's actions (3â€“6 lines).
2) For each MCP call:
   - Confirm artifact paths and add links to `status.md` -> Artifacts.
   - Ensure `.assistant/task_log.md` has entries.
3) Update `backlog.md` statuses; move done items; add follow-ups.
4) Refresh `status.md` (Focus, Risks, Artifacts, Changelog).
5) If a decision was made, create an ADR file and list it in `status.md` -> Artifacts.
6) Output a short "Next session: Now/Next" list.
7) **Sync `.assistant/status.md -> Open Questions` with `.assistant/canvas/questions.md`.**
   - If a question was answered, remove or mark it as resolved in both places.
   - If new questions were raised, add them to both files.
