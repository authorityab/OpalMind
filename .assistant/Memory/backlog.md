## Todo
| ID | Title | Notes |
|----|-------|-------|
| SDK-010C | Service health monitoring | Add proactive health checks for Matomo/externals and surface status in tooling |
| SDK-010D | Contextual error guidance | Map common Matomo errors to actionable remediation tips within responses |
| SDK-010E | Rate limit awareness | Detect API quota limits, throttle requests, and inform users when limits are hit |
| SDK-010F | Idempotent request support | Ensure repeatable write operations avoid duplicate effects during retries |
| INF-004 | Structured logging | Replace console with Pino/Winston in production and restrict stdout to warn/error levels |
| BUG-001 | Handle NaN key metrics | `getKeyNumbers` returns `NaN` for `nb_visits` on week/long ranges; guard parsing + add fallback |
| SDK-011 | Analyze historical key numbers | Derive peak values across key metrics from GetKeyNumbersHistorical data and present results |
| SDK-012A | Clarify ambiguous analytics requests | Add follow-up prompts/default periods when time range is missing |
| SDK-012B | Long-running request feedback | Surface progress indicators for expensive Matomo data fetches |
| SDK-012C | Interactive analytics follow-ups | Offer next-step suggestions (e.g., top 5 days, comparisons) after results |
| SDK-012D | Personalized reporting defaults | Learn per-user period preferences and apply automatically |
| SDK-013A | Trend analysis insights | Detect week-over-week changes and seasonal patterns in historical metrics |
| SDK-013B | Anomaly detection | Flag significant spikes/dips in metrics relative to typical ranges |
| SDK-013C | Comparative analytics | Support cross-period/segment/site comparisons within Matomo reports |
| SDK-013D | Predictive forecasting | Offer simple forward-looking projections based on historical trends |
| SDK-014A | Cross-tool data correlation | Combine Matomo analytics with external campaign data to explain traffic spikes |
| SDK-014B | Automated reporting schedules | Allow recurring summary delivery (e.g., weekly top pages reports) |
| SDK-014C | Export analytics results | Provide CSV/PDF export options for Matomo insights |
| SDK-015 | Funnel analytics support | Wrap Matomo Funnels API (or goal/event composition) into an Opal tool for step-wise drop-off summaries |
| SDK-016 | Site search keyword insights | Add `getInternalSearchKeywords` helper wrapping `Actions.getSiteSearchKeywords` with optional filters and expose via Opal tool |
| SDK-017 | Page transitions reporting | Wrap `Transitions.getTransitionsForPage` into a structured Opal tool highlighting previous/next pages, exits, and loops |

## Parking Lot
- Potential Redis cache layer for reporting responses.
- Optional Docusaurus docs site post-MVP.
## Notes
- Current baseline is stable; tag or record this commit before major changes so you can revert if new work regresses behaviour.
- Process reminder: update this backlog immediately whenever a task is completed so Done/Todo stay accurate.
- | SDK-009A | Test ideas tool signature | todo | Add goal/change-size/customer-data params to the ideation endpoint + update types |
- | SDK-009B | Context-aware prioritisation | todo | Weight OXS heuristics using new params + map goals/change size to suggestions |
- | SDK-009C | LLM prompt & instructions | todo | Refresh tool descriptions and guidance so channel/test goal queries route correctly |
- | SDK-009D | Docs & samples for CRO inputs | todo | Document the new knobs in README + sample requests |
