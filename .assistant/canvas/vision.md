# Vision & Mission

OpalMind empowers LLM-driven assistants to answer Matomo analytics questions and trigger tracking actions safely. Success means product and ops teams can rely on a single API + SDK layer that converts Matomo’s complex Reporting and Tracking APIs into predictable, typed workflows suitable for Opal integrations.

- Problem statement: Matomo’s APIs are powerful but inconsistent, making it difficult for automated agents to query analytics or fire tracking events without bespoke glue code.
- Target users: Internal AI assistant developers, analytics engineers, and ops staff who embed Matomo insights into conversational flows.
- Mission: Provide a hardened SDK and Opal-compatible API façade that delivers trustworthy analytics summaries, diagnostics, and tracking helpers with minimal configuration.
- Success criteria: By Q4 2025, OpalMind is the preferred bridge between Authority’s LLM tooling and Matomo instances, with monitoring and deployment guides enabling hands-off operations.
- Non-goals: Replacing Matomo’s dashboards or building multi-tenant billing; deep observability dashboards live outside this project for now.
