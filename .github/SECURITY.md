# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support and triage security reports for the latest `main` branch and the most recent tagged release. Earlier releases may receive fixes on a best-effort basis if the patch can be applied safely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email [putte.arvfors@authority.se](mailto:putte.arvfors@authority.se) with a detailed description of the vulnerability, reproduction steps, and any suggested mitigations. You can expect an acknowledgement within **72 hours**.

If you require encrypted communication, request our PGP key in your initial message and we will respond with the details.

## Disclosure Process

1. We confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact.
2. A fix or mitigation is developed, tested, and prepared for release.
3. We coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter. Critical issues are typically disclosed within **30 days** of the initial report, or sooner if a fix is ready.
4. Once a release with the fix is available, we publish a security advisory summarizing the issue and resolution, and notify the reporter.

We appreciate your help in keeping OpalMind and its users safe.
